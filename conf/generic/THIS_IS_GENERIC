    The GENERIC location doesn't exist!

    this directory exist only for show an example of configuration for the sniffjoke user
and to provide to the sniffjoke-autotest.

    Sj transparently make a traceroute-like for every IP address you contact, it use an internal cache 
(the ttlfocus.bin file) and keep track of which IP/TCP options will work in you network. 

    The combination of IP options usable is really unstable, a bad usage of an option will cause your 
session to be entirely broken. 
This is the reason because has been developed the "sniffjoke-autotest" script. It make a lot of automatical 
probe and generate the configuration file related to your network+ISP. 

    So you need to run an autotest in every location you want to use sniffjoke (eg: your home, office, 
starbuck, etc..) because the 'generic' location provided, is useful only as configuration example.
