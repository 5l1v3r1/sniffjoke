the directory 'generic/' contains the default configuration settings.

is copyed in /usr/local/var/sniffjoke/ 

this directory contains the "location directory"

every location is a network place where you use sniffjoke, you need to configure
every location separately, and generic will work for the most of the time.

* WHAT IS sniffjoke-autotest ? 

Is a script performing some sniffjoke usage for detect which kind of attack will 
be used in your network.
The problem is: not every kind of evasion technology will work in every network, 
and beside a manual verification, sniffjoke-autotest will make him job)
it take as argumet the location name, and create the new directory:
/usr/local/var/sniffjoke/$NEWLOCATION
putting inside the related configuration files

When you need to use a specific locaton, run sniffjoke --location $LOCATIONNAME and
the related directory will be used to chroot into, write logs and caches.

* WHAT DOES IT MEAN EVERY SINGLE CONFIG FILE ?

***	plugins-enabled.conf

It contains the list of the plugins to use in your sniffjoke service. The plugins
are the shared object contained in src/plugins and installed in 
/usr/local/lib/sniffjoke/*.so
the configuration file contains these information:

# comment
plugin_name.so,SCRAMBLETECHSUPPORTED1,SCRAMBLETECHSUPPORTED2,...

the plugin_name.so is exposed without path and intended to be found in the 
/usr/local/lib/sniffjoke directory. the scramble technology are separated by
a comma and without whitespace, and will be:

PRESCRIPTION
    is the scramble technology that decreare the TTL in the
    packet causing to expire before reach the remote host

INNOCENT
    is a valid packet injected inside the stream

MALFORMED
    is a packet with rfc-valid but incoheren by the usege
    in relation with the connection state of IP and TCP options
    or other malformation based on IP/TCP options header.
GUILTY
    packet with bad checksum, discarged by the remote host
    but accepted by the sniffer (very rare, is the less useful
    scramble but useful in the sniffjoke logic)

***	sniffjoke-service.conf

It does contain the same options that will be passed by command line:


active
    will be present or not present, and is used if sniffjoke must start 
	active in hijacking/injection or start and silently make mitm in
	the network without packet injection and session tracking
	default: not present
user
    specify the username to downgrade privileges after chrooting
	default: nobody
	suggested: the mantainer will create a sniffjoke user
group
    the same of user
	default: nogroup
	suggested: creation of sniffjoke group
management-address
	is the ip address where sniffjoke will bind the administrative socket,
	is a required configuration if you plan to use sniffjoke in a gateway 
	and manage the service by your client
	default: 127.0.0.1
management-port
	the UDP port for the administrative traffic
	default: 8844

	note: the two management info, need to be passed in the sniffjokeclt
	(the client managing sniffjoke service) to the command line.

debug
    the verbosity level used by sniffjoke:
	1: suppress log, no one line are provided 
	2: common, startup info and error reporting
	3: verbose, description and check of I/O operation
	4: debug, intensive and complete I/O description
	5: session, creation of $LOGFILENAME.session and session debug 
	6: packets, creation of $LOGFILENAME.packet and debug of every packet
	default: 2

foreground
	will be present or not and simple don't goes in default or goes.
	default: no

*** ipblacklist.conf

this is a series of ip address, written without every other information, and
whenever the blacklist is set in sniffjoke, the connection destinated to a
matching IP address will work untouched by sniffjoke

*** ipwhitelist.conf

this is the same of blacklist, but you specify the only ip address that will 
be hacked.

*** port-aggressivity.conf

this is how the default and simplest section appears:

# this is always on the top of the port definition file, act as default
1:65535     NORMAL,COMMON

# follow the port rules
22          RARE,LIGHT
23,25,110   COMMON,NORMAL
80,8080     PEEKATSTART,EVERY5SECONDS,HEAVY
6667,7000   ALWAYS,NORMAL

# edonkey p2p
4600:4800   EVERY20SECONDS,LIGHT

you need to select the destination TCP ports, use as separator "," or ":"
with the "," you should address the single port and with the ":" a range.
