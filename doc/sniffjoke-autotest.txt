This directory contains the scripts for sniffjoke testing, analysis etc.

1) sniffjoke-autotest

WHY IS IMPORTANT MAKE THOSE TEST

The hack a technique able to defeat the sniffer, but:

1) some hacks work in a sniffer and not in the other
2) some hacks are simply theoretical
3) some hacks are deducted reading the kernel policy and the RFCs
4) some routers silently discarge our injected packets and 
5) some firewalls drop them because seem corrupted 
6) some kernels acquire the injected packet ruining the session, 
   or almost the congestion window if not the data.

for those reasons an intesive testing is useful, and after you have installed
sniffjoke, run:

# ./sniffjoke-autotest -l <LOCATION_NAME> -d /usr/local/var/sniffjoke/ -n 1

Maybe some distribution use other path, found where sniffjoke is with:

# whereis sniffjoke

And use it with "-d".

The "sniffjoke-autotest" script uses a one time chroot environment under /tmp, and collects
information about which kind of hacks your network permits to use. the test are done
searching in www.delirandom.net/sniffjoke/testsuite.info, the address of the server 
available for the test. at the time three servers are used, one with different remote operating system
(FIXME - define them ) and the server is distributed because I want to avoid
an eccessive use of the tests (I don't know how much bandwidth will be consumed, and 
I will assure that the server used are related to the sniffjoke developer, will not
keep logs about sniffjoke users and if you want make those test by yourself, you are free to do that)

1) require to be runned as root
2) create a lot of dump in /tmp/ directory, that are not removed at the end of the test
3) connect to http://www.delirandom.net/sniffjoke_test/post_echo.php
   and other servers are welcomed
4) POST the files, records the answers, verify md5sum, records timings, records .pcap
5) generate automatically the new location, in /usr/local/var/sniffjoke/NEWLOCATION

after you will use sniffjoke with your custom configuration:

sniffjoke --location NEWLOCATION
