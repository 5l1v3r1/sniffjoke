This directory contains the scripts for sniffjoke testing, analysis etc.

1) sniffjoke-autotest

WHY IS IMPORTANT MAKE THOSE TEST

The hack a technique able to defeat the sniffer, but:

1) some hacks work in a sniffer and not in the other
2) some hacks are simply theoretical
3) some hacks are deducted reading the kernel policy and the RFCs
4) some routers silently discarge our injected packets and 
5) some firewalls drop them because seem corrupted 
6) some kernels acquire the injected packet ruining the session, 
   or almost the congestion window if not the data.

for those reasons an intesive testing is useful, and after you have installed
sniffjoke, run:

# ./sniffjoke-autotest <LOCATION_NAME>

if sniffjoke is not in the default path (/usr/local/bin/sniffjoke), put as first
argument your real path:

# ./sniffjoke-autotest <LOCATION_NAME> /sbin/sniffjoke

maybe some distribution use other path, found where sniffjoke is with:

# whereis sniffjoke

the "sniffjoke-autotest" use a one time chroot environment under /tmp, and collect
information about witch kind of hacks your network permit to use. the test are done
searching in www.delirandom.net/sniffjoke/testsuite.info, the address of the server 
available for the test. are three server, with different remote operating system
(FIXME - define them ) and the server is distributed because I want to avoid
an eccessive use of the tests (I don't know how much bandwidth will be consumed, and 
I will assure that the server used are related to the sniffjoke developer, will not
keep logs about sniffjoke users and if you want make those test by yourself, you will)

1) require to be runned as root
2) create a lot of dump in /tmp/ directory, that are not removed at the end of the test
3) connect to http://www.delirandom.net/sniffjoke_test/post_echo.php
4) POST the files, records the answers, verify md5sum, records timings, records .pcap
