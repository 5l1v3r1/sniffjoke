Sniffjoke 0.4 usage

sniffjoke --help

this command returns three piece of information,

	the option usefull when sniffjoke is started (by hand or by init script)

 --config [filename]	config file [default: /usr/local/var/sniffjoke/sjconf.bin]
 --enabler [filename]	plugins enabler file [default: /usr/local/etc/sniffjoke/plugins_enabled.txt]
 --user [username]	downgrade priviledge to the specified user [default: sniffjoke]
 --group [groupname]	downgrade priviledge to the specified group [default: sniffjoke]
 --chroot-dir [dir]	runs chroted into the specified dir [default: /usr/local/var/sniffjoke/]
 --logfile [file]	set a logfile, [default: /usr/local/var/sniffjoke/sniffjoke.log]
 --debug [level 1-6]	set up verbosoty level [default: 2]
			1: suppress log, 2: common, 3: verbose, 4: debug, 5: session 6: packets
 --foreground		running in foreground [default:background]
 --force		force restart if sniffjoke service
 --version		show sniffjoke version
 --help			show this help (special --help hacking)

	when sniffjoke is running keep on memory the configuration settings and dump them
	in a binary file, sniffjoke run under chroot directory and inside them there are files
	usefull for sniffjoke and for the user.

	when you start sniffjoke it use the default chroot directory where the configuration
	settings, the unix socket, the networking analysis cache and the logfile are stored.

	the option usefull when sniffjoke is running, and neet to be managed (usually called client mode)

while sniffjoke is running, you should send one of those commands as command line argument:

 start			start sniffjoke hijacking/injection
 stop			stop sniffjoke (but remain tunnel interface active)
 quit			stop sniffjoke, save config, abort the service
 saveconf		dump config file
 stat			get statistics about sniffjoke configuration and network
 info			get massive info about sniffjoke internet stats
 showport		show TCP ports strongness of injection
 set start end value	set per tcp ports the strongness of injection
 			the values are: [heavy|normal|light|none]
 			example: sniffjoke set 22 80 heavy
 clear			alias to "set 1 65535 none"
 loglevel		[1-6] change the loglevel

	those command are used and accepted only when sniffjoke is running and the 
	"client instance" found the unix socket used for communication. Default unix 
	sockets are /usr/local/var/sniffjoke/sniffjoke_client and 
	/usr/local/var/sniffjoke/sniffjoke_service, if your service has been started 
	with --chroot-dir options, this will be used in the instance too (because otherwise
	the client don't know where the sockets are placed)

	when you set your port rules, save the configuration with saveconf and continue
	to use sniffjoke. when you restart sniffjoke, using the same --chroot-dir, the 
	previous configurations are reloaded.

when sniffjoke is is on testing mode, other options are used (by the script sniffjoke-testsuite)



[*] DEFAULTS:

	the default are hardcoded in the software, passed compile time from the building script,
	maybe a distribution-specific package will contains different path
