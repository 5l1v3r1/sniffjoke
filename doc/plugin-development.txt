hacks FREQUENCY vs hacks PROBABILITY

an hack will not always be used, for two reasons:

1) every hack is bandwitdh usage, and we dislike add proportional overweight
2) if an hack is used evetytime, will be easily detected by an updated sniffer

an efficent hack, is used when happen, and the happening is somehow related to
the application protocol we aim to protect. eg: a IRC chat is a session long 
almost hours fill with sensible data, an http get is sensible only on the
sending of the get, and an email is full of sensibile data send in short time.

in addiction, some hack is based in sending fake data double time the size of
the original packet, this is intensive and an user should define the flexibility
of the injection.
