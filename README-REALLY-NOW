SniffJoke 0.3 - 2010.03.30

GPL software by vecna - <vecna@delirandom.net>

SniffJoke is a software implementing sniffer evasion techniques.
It Is implemented in C++, and at the moment tested only under Linux
environment.

HOW TO COMPILE/INSTALL:

cd sniffjoke-src/
./configure && make 
./sniffjoke 

Remember:

1) If you start SniffJoke without the configuration parameter sniffjoke will use
   settings present in /root/sniffjoke/sniffjoke.conf).
   If that file does not exist SniffJoke will initialize it with default setting
   or settings provided in command line arguments.
3) SniffJoke is a software that mangles kernel traffic in userspace. To satisfy
   this condition it requires some weird hack, like creation of a
   fake-tunnel interface and use of the same local IP address. SniffJoke tries
   to be verbose for the user. Detailed documentation will follow, but maybe
   only in Italian language.
