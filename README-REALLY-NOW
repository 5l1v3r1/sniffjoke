SniffJoke 0.3 - 2009.04.02

GPL software by vecna - <vecna@delirandom.net>

SniffJoke is a software implementing sniffer evasion techniques.
It Is implemented in C++, and at the moment tested only under Linux
environment.
It uses a local web interface, provided by SWILL (http://swill.sf.net) library
by David Beazley, Sotiria Lampoudi, Gonzalo Diethelm. Thanks for your
work. One copy of SWILL 0.2 is distributed in this SniffJoke package.

HOW TO COMPILE/INSTALL:

cd swill-0.2-src/
./configure && make && make install
cd ..
cd sniffjoke-src/
./configure && make 
./sniffjoke 

Remember:

1) Current running configuration is available by default at
   http://127.0.0.1:8844 .
2) If you start SniffJoke without the configuration parameter (default
   configuration file is /etc/sniffjoke.conf) SniffJoke will not save your
   settings.
3) SniffJoke is a software that mangles kernel traffic in userspace. To satisfy
   this condition it requires some weird hack, like creation of a
   fake-tunnel interface and use of the same local IP address. SniffJoke tries
   to be verbose for the user. Detailed documentation will follow, but maybe
   only in Italian language.
