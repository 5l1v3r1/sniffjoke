# SniffJoke: transparent TCP connection scrambler 0.5-devel

SniffJoke is an application for Linux that handle transparently your TCP connection, delaying, modifyng and inject fake packets inside your transmission, make them almost impossible to be correctly readed by a passive wiretapping technology (IDS or sniffer)

# Requirements

    janus package: http://github.com/evilavliv3/janus the nighly release
    libevent installed (developed and tested with the 1.4.2 version)
    libpcap
    cmake (minimum version required: 2.8)
    gcc/g++ (4.2.4 version tested & developed)

Suggested

    gnupg



# TODO, for stabilize 0.5

    implement/fix the new scrambling tech
    verify libevent supports
    Janus stabilization and portability supports
    IP/TCP opt no more autotested
    Strong use of cache
    location self-recognition, location concept need to be linked with janus

# SniffJoke directory explaination

    dist/doc

documentation, txt, explanation and so on

    dist/generic

the base configuration, every location will start from the 'generic' location

    dist/sjA

sniffjoke autotest scripts, the web service used for test sniffjoke reialability since a location, and (TODO) analysis and stats

    src/service

the core of the project, C++ code that compiled give the sniffjoke binary

    src/client

sniffjoke will be controlled by command line at the startup, or via commands given by a client. In this times, also a windows client is under development, and the client should be remote from Sj (that should be remote from janus)

    src/plugins

the attack metodoloy to defeat sniffer will be improved, personally implemented and enable on requests. plugins contains the C++ classes compiled as shared library, loaded at the startup.

# Janus

SniffJoke since the release 0.5 works only in conjunction with a Janus instance. Janus is a "traffic diverter" and should run in the same host where Sj is running, or in a different hosts.

Since the 0.5 release, SniffJoke aim to became fully portable, and Janus provide network handling (and portability issue)

# How to compile/install
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make 
    sudo -s
    make install

# How to use SniffJoke

you need to have installed Janus, stable release at http://github.com/evilaliv3/janus

# Suggested setup, for configure your network capabilities
    sniffjoke-autotest -l name_of_your_location 

since you have runned the "autotest" in this network location (office, home, lab, etc...) you will invoke sniffjoke with:

    sniffjoke --location name_of_your_location
    sniffjokectl --stat
    sniffjokectl --start
    sniffjokectl --help
    [...]

# CACHE and LOGs that should be generated in a location

# CONFIG FILES generated as location specific by sniffjoke-autotest

## Installed files 

This is the 'generic' (act as a default) location. Remind: every network location you're using (your office, your home, etc), track different cache. using a cache collected in a different location will cause the total corruption of the connections, and therfore before use sniffjoke you have to create a sperate directory for every network places you are using. In the future, this selection will be automatized using the mac address+IP of the default gateway in order to detect a different location.

# External service

Sniffjoke in autotesting required to contact http://www.delirandom.net/sjA, this is not striclty required
and if an user want to perform himself the test, will install the "pe.php" script, present in this package.
and using the semi-secret options -s and -a in sniffjoke-autotest (you will avoid every contact w/ delirandom)
