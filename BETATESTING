Hi betatester, I'm glad you are reading this file:

simple usage:

# sniffjoke 
(without options, or with --option, sniffjoke goes in background and start the service, listening
in UDP port 8844 waiting for management commands)

# sniffjoke command
(the command without "--", are used for start, stop, set TCP port policy, view info and stats)

test you could do:

1) test sniffjoke in your system;
2) try to run script/sniffjoke-testsuite and check the output in /tmp/sniffjoke-stats;
3) try to edit your enabler file (default: /usr/local/etc/sniffjoke/plugins_enabled.txt)
   and use other hacks;
4) try to configure TCP ports with "sniffjoke set";
5) try sniffjoke in different network environments (some examples: your office wifi, your home lan, etc...).

optional:

- if you work as a distribution package mantainer, you could try to make a sniffjoke package; the default
  user used in privilege downgrade are nobody/nogroup. in your install script you will add the
  sniffjoke user/group and modify the default in src/hardcoded-defines.h

- if you seen a lot of english typos :P please fix them or suggest correction to us;

- if you want to translate the documentation in your language, we are glad to support your tranalation
  in the sniffjoke official website (at the moment in rebuilding);

- if you had some ideas about TCP hacks, study the plugins and the hacks/hack_skeleton.skel example,
  we are glad to import your plugins.


for every question or segnalations, please sent an email to both of the developers:

thanks for your support,
the Sniffjoke Jokers
