1) test sniffjoke in your system
2) try to run script/sniffjoke-testsuite and check the output in /tmp/sniffjoke-stats
3) try to edit your enabler file (default: /usr/local/etc/sniffjoke/plugins_enabled.txt)
   and use other hacks
4) try to configure TCP ports with "sniffjoke set"
5) try sniffjoke in different network environment (your office wifi, your home lan, etc...)

optional:

if you work in distrubtion package, try to make a sniffjoke package to add in your distribution
