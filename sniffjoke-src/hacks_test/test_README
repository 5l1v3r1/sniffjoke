This directory contains the script and the subdir for make the TCP hacks test.

WHY IS IMPORTANT MAKE THOSE TEST

The hack a technique able to defeat the sniffer, but:

1) some hacks work in a sniffer and not in the other
2) some hacks are simply theoretical
3) some hacks are deducted reading the kernel policy and the RFCs
4) some routers silently discarge our injected packets and 
5) some firewalls drop them because seem corrupted 
6) some kernels acquire the injected packet ruining the session, 
   or almost the congestion window if not the data.

for those reasons an intesive testing is useful, the script:

./sniffjoke-brutal-test.sh

make those tests, checking if the download is correct, the timing and sniffing the
data in order to verify in a sniffer the (badly) reassembled TCP flow


HOW DOES ./sniffjoke-brutal-test.sh WORK ?

1) require to be runned as root
2) for each test is created a subdir 1/ 2/ 3/ ... 12/
3) set sniffjoke to run only to the port 80
4) set, for each time, a different hack (using the --hacking option)
5) generate 5 files, formed with 1024 line, each line appear like:
	sniffjoke test N: [1-5]: [1-1024]
6) generate the md5sum of each file
7) connect to http://www.delirandom.net/sniffjoke_test/post_echo.php
8) POST the files, records the answers, verify md5sum, records timings, records .pcap
