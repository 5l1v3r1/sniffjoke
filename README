SniffJoke 0.4 beta 1

Yes, thanks FSF, now is 2010, and SniffJoke will be used for the most
in the 2011/2012, after the 2012 the world will be destroyed by the
maya-curse, and sniffing will became the second problem in the list.

Anyway, if you are reading this file asking to you: "HOW I WILL 
INSTALL sniffjoke ?" ./configure && make && sudo && make install

FSF is optimistic and belives that you will compile SniffJoke in
a different system beside Linux 2.6.19, (due to the use of ppoll).

If you are interested to install it on your system or to develop
a port, you can,  we (vecna + evilaliv3) are plesed and wish that
some people will mail to us telling something like:

 "hello sniffjoke developer, I'm a (FreeBSD|MacOSX|OpenBSD) user and 
  developer, and I'm porting sniffjoke to my system. why don't we
  integrate our work each other ?"

and this will obviously be our answer:

  <vecna+evilaliv3> "sure! you welcome."
