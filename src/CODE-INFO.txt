This file works as a TODO&REMIND:

. TTLFocus.cc an interesting analysis should derive from a visual correlation of TTL
  distance and difference between network topology change for every path. because 
  asymmetric network may cause that your SENDING path change the numer of hops, and 
  your INCOMING path does not. This is the biggest problem because TTL hacking 
  injection is the most strong sniffer evasion tech available.


for every questione, code hacking, plugin proposal & improvement, every submission
is welcome to: vecna@delirandom.net, cc: giovanni.pellerano@evilaliv3.org
