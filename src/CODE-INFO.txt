This file works as a TODO&REMIND:

. DataDebug.cc at the moment is not used, it should be cutted off or keep, anyway we need 
  a clean way to used it, call it, and collect the log. Makefile compile and link it 
  again, but is not called

. TTLFocus.cc an interesting analysis should derive from a visual correlation of TTL
  distance and difference between network topology change for every path. because 
  asymmetric network may cause that your SENDING path change the numer of hops, and 
  your INCOMING path does not. This is the biggest problem because TTL hacking 
  injection is the most strong sniffer evasion tech available.


for every questione, code hacking, plugin proposal & improvement, every submission
is welcom to: vecna@delirandom.net, cc: giovanni.pellerano@evilaliv3.org

future site release will contain an upload/download system. if you have a nice idea 
about make it, contacts ours, we are always looking for community helps :)
