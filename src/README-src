/service:
        contains the main sources for the sniffjoke software

/client:
        contains sources for a command line interface written to manage
        sniffjoke service;
        in doc/ you will find the file SJ-PROTOCOL.txt, ad document that
        describe the protocol used for service-client communication.
        if you want to write a QT or other cool-GUI sniffjoke manager,
        we are glad to import it.

/plugins:
        sniffjoke is an "anti sniffing SDK" or a "framework for userspace
        connection mangling" and the plugins are in fact the funny little
        code able to crumble to dust the thousand-dollar IDS apparatus
        your boss has buyed.

        inside the dir there is the file hack_skeleton.skel, a skeleton that
        shows you how to develop yours. --> REMIND, hack_skeleton.skel need to be updated
