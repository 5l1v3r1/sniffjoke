Hi,

In this directory you will found a "sniffjoke-autotest" that should SEEM the script installed in your box: is not.

The installed script is generated when cmake runs, taking from "unusable-sj-autotest.sh" and filling some variables
with system dependent values (eg: each distros has different installation path, and autotest know them in this way)

the generation of the script is commanded by CMakeLists.txt and __extract_line.sh

===

If you are the package mantainer, you have to run cmake installation and generate the sniffjoke-autotest for your
distro, before build the package
