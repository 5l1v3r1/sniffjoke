# [*] except, of course, if the hypothetical attack you are planning, is a 
#     local root one shot with race condition and user interation. 
#     you could try to modify config.h between the cmake analysis of service/ 
#     and autotest/, changing the path and making a script injection inside 
#     sniffjoke-autotest, sooner or later executed by root.

#     for this reason, I've a put some input filtering, but, you know, will be 
#Â     not enough.
