This hack, scatter_packet.cc, in EXPERIMENTAL and doesn't work at the moment.

Is a research in progress based on management of overlapped chunk from different stacks

warning wtf, I've a doubt.

If a sent a seq 100 with 100 bytes, 80 real and 20 fake.
and my next packet is 100, obviously the 20 fake are recorded.

the overlapping data will be reach only if I sent before 100 (fake) with the sequence of 100+seq,
and after I sent at the sequence of seq+50 50 bytes.
